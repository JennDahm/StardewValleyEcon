# Basic Functionality

* Actually implement price changes.
* Determine whether we want to deal with config file versioning.
  That is, if the version in the config file doesn't match the version of the
  mod, what do we do?

# Extended Functionality
* Do we allow events affecting multiple items at once? Maybe necessary - crops and their seeds, for example.
* Do we allow multiple events of the same type? That is, two weekly events at once?
* Do we add a news broadcast to the TV as flavor? (See Daily News mod)
* Do we try to factor in Supply & Demand or other more complicated economic models?
