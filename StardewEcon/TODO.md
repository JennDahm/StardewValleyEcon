# Basic Functionality

* Figure out how to configure list of items, locations, etc. Should we use plain
  text configuration files like with event headlines?
* Figure out how to configure price ranges and probabilities. Different per item,
  or per event duration?
* Figure out how we seed the RNG; system time every use for complete randomness?
  Game day + Player ID for player-based determinism?
* Figure out how to trigger the news bulletin menu when interacting with the
  sign outside Pierre's shop.
* Figure out how we store and retrieve current events from player save.

# Extended Functionality
* Do we allow events affecting multiple items at once?
* Do we add a news broadcast to the TV as flavor? (See Daily News mod)
* Do we try to factor in Supply & Demand or other more complicated economic models?
