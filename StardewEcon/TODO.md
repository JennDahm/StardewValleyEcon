# Basic Functionality

* Parse events properly and generate items and price changes appropriately.
  * Figure out how to configure list of items, locations, etc. Should we use plain
    text configuration files like with event headlines?
  * Figure out how to configure price ranges and probabilities. Different per item,
    or per event duration?
* Figure out how to trigger the news bulletin menu when interacting with the
  sign outside Pierre's shop.

# Extended Functionality
* Do we allow events affecting multiple items at once?
* Do we add a news broadcast to the TV as flavor? (See Daily News mod)
* Do we try to factor in Supply & Demand or other more complicated economic models?
